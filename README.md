Description

Design a Student Profile Portal to manage and showcase student information at NITK. The platform will serve as a centralized hub for students to manage details about their 
academics, clubs, achievements, research work, internships, skills, projects, etc. Students can selectively choose which details to make public for others to view on their
profiles. The platform will also be useful for institution to maintain a comprehensive student database.


Your task is to create a high-fidelity user interface (UI) and user flow using Figma with prototyping to demonstrate how the portal will function.
